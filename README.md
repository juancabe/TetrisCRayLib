# Tetris Clone

This project is a simple Tetris clone written in C using the Raylib library for graphics rendering. It's designed to run on desktop platforms.

## Features

- Basic Tetris gameplay mechanics
- Collision detection

- Next and saved piece preview
- Game over detection and restart

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- GCC compiler
- Raylib library

## Compilation

The project includes a Makefile for easy compilation. Use the following commands:

```sh
make main
```

This will compile the source code into an executable named [`main`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjuan%2FDocuments%2FTetris%2Fmain%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/juan/Documents/Tetris/main").

## Running the Game

After compilation, you can start the game using:

```sh
make run
```

Or directly:

```sh
./main
```

## Controls

- Arrow keys for moving the pieces.
- Space to save a piece for later.
- Enter to restart the game after a game over.

## Configuration

The game's settings can be adjusted in the [`main.c`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjuan%2FDocuments%2FTetris%2Fmain.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/juan/Documents/Tetris/main.c") file, including screen size, block size, and colors.
